## General Deployment Rules (Must Read)

- Always **fork the repository** before deploying.
- Never hardcode secrets in source code.
- Never push `.env`, API keys, or session strings to GitHub.
- Monitor logs after deployment.
- You are responsible for compliance with platform policies.

Failure to follow these rules can result in service suspension or account restrictions.

- Telegram `API_ID` & `API_HASH`
- Telegram Bot Token
- Telegram User String Session
- MongoDB URI
- Custom YouTube API Key [Get From Here](https://t.me/aboutbrokenx) 
- ffmpeg available in runtime

All values must be set using **environment variables only**.

## VPS Deployment (Recommended for Production)

Best choice for **stability, performance, and control**.

### Minimum Requirements
- Ubuntu 20.04+
- 1 GB RAM (2 GB recommended)
- Python 3.9+
- ffmpeg installed

### Basic Steps (High Level)

1. Update system
2. Install dependencies
3. Clone your fork
4. Create virtual environment
5. Install requirements
6. Start bot using `tmux` or `systemd`

### Why VPS is Recommended
- No sleep
- Full control
- Better audio stability
- No forced rate limits

---

## Docker Deployment (Advanced / Recommended)

Docker is ideal if you want:
- Isolation
- Easy restarts
- Predictable runtime

### Docker Compose (Preferred)

Start with:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

### Warnings
- Do not bake secrets into the image
- Use `.env` only
- Monitor logs with `docker logs`

---

## Platform Comparison

| Platform | Stability | Recommended |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| VPS | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Yes (Production) |
| Docker VPS | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Yes |
| Heroku | ⭐⭐ | Testing only |
| Render | ⭐⭐⭐ | Light usage |
| Railway | ⭐⭐⭐ | Medium usage |
| Koyeb | ⭐⭐⭐ | Medium usage |

---

## Common Deployment Mistakes

- Missing ffmpeg
- Exposed `.env`
- Wrong API key
- Using cookies on cloud
- Running without background process

Avoiding these will save significant debugging time.
